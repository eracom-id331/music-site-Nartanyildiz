                    <p>Steven Dale Lewis II[1] (born November 14, 2006), known professionally as tana (formerly known as
                        BabySantana), is an American singer, rapper, and songwriter. He rose to popularity within the
                        early
                        months
                        of 2021 with his hit singles "14" (with Ka$hdami) and "Antisocial" (featuring Slump6s) which
                        gained
                        traction
                        throughout TikTok and SoundCloud.[2] He then later signed to his first major label Galactic — a
                        subsidiary
                        of Republic Records within the late months of 2021.</p>

                    <p>
                        Steven Lewis was born on November 14, 2006, in Columbus, Georgia, and was raised by his single
                        mother.
                        Growing up in Columbus, he found work at a bread factory to save up money to buy equipment to
                        make songs
                        – along with financial help from his supportive mother. He would record his songs in a small
                        closet in
                        his house – solely engineering, mixing, and mastering all his work on Audacity, later upgrading
                        to FL
                        Studio.

                        tana grew up being heavily inspired by the Chicago trap scene, which at the time was led by
                        Chief Keef
                        and the late Fredo Santana — who also inspired his former rap alias BabySantana, alongside
                        BabyTron.[4

                        tana started his music career in 2020, sharing music through platforms such as YouTube and
                        SoundCloud by
                        May of that year. Shortly after, tana kept practicing on his sound and also started to learn how
                        to
                        produce music. He later formed a small collective with his friends titled 1500[5] — which at
                        first only
                        included Slump6s, although additional artists and producers were recruited throughout upcoming
                        years.
                        This collective would ultimately be disbanded in 2022.</p>

                        He then came to fame in 2020, subsequent to his single "Prada" after it went viral on social
                        media
                        platforms; which would lead to a remix with label associate, Lil Tecca.[6] He later released
                        three
                        projects that year; those being Recreation, Quan and Planet Sosa – however, Recreation and Quan
                        would be
                        deleted from all platforms at later dates, leaving only Planet Sosa on streaming services.
                        tana's career
                        would later peak in 2021, after his Slump6s-assisted single "Antisocial" would go viral;
                        which also led to an official sequel featuring SSGKobe, Xhulooo and Yung Fazo.

                        Alongside Lil Tecca, tana is associated with artists including KA$HDAMI, midwxst, yvngxchris
                        among
                        others. He is currently signed to Galactic Records — a subsidiary of Republic Records, although
                        tana
                        still continues to release music independently through his SoundCloud, as well as through
                        multiple
                        alternate SoundCloud accounts.[7] tana and fellow rapper KA$HDAMI featured on the Lyrical

                        YouTube channel with their hit collaboration "14" on July 20, 2021.[8] </p>
